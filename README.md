## Project Overview
To give customers a flawless shopping experience, Gadget Heaven is built with React and makes use of a number of core ideas and tools. A user-friendly interface and well-structured code for scalability and maintainability are features of the project.

## React Fundamentals Used

- **Components**: UI is built with modular and reusable components, ensuring maintainability and consistency across the application.
- **React Router**: Provides a seamless multi-page app experience, handling routes for `Home`, `Statistics`, `Dashboard`, and `Support` pages.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Renders different views based on user actions and current state (e.g., toggling between `Cart` and `Wishlist`).
- **State Management with Hooks**: Leverages `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for efficient state management across components.
- **Dynamic Page Titles**: `useEffect` is used to update the browser title dynamically for each page, enhancing both UX and SEO.

### Data Handling and Persistence

- **Local Storage**:  `Cart` and `Wishlist` data, allowing users to retain their selections even after refreshing or returning to the site.


### Key Features

1. **Dynamic Category Browsing**
2. **Cart and Wishlist management with sorting options**
3. **Page navigation for `Home`, `Statistics`, `Dashboard`, and `Support`**
4. **Purchase confirmation with modal feedback**
5. **Interactive price sorting and cost calculation for items in Cart or Wishlist**
